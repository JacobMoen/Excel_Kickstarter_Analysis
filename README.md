# Analysis of Kickstarter Fundraising Campaigns

### Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
We can conclude that theater, music, and film & video are the most active parent categories for crowd funding. We can also conclude that each parent category and subcategory have similar outcome proportions regardless of participation volume. Finally, we can conclude that the outcome proportions are consistent throughout the year.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?
The industry and subindustry data are the main descriptions we have for the businesses. There are many other things we may want to sort by, size, online/brick and mortar, age etc... The “blurbs” are too diverse to analyze. 

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
There could be a graph that compare success outcome by geographic location. This could help to point out differences in communities’ willingness to invest.
